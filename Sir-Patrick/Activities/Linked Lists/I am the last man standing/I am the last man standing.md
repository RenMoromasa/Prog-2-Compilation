I am the last man standing

Create a function removeAfter() that would remove all items after a given number. The function would accept the collection of numbers stored in a linked list data structure (use the structure definition defined in the myheader.h) and the given number. The function would return a new collection of the deleted numbers after the given number.

No need to implement the functions in the myheader.h; they have already been implemented and are hidden from you.

Add your answer below the labeled/commented section in the code specified by "Answer No.1 and Answer No.2".
