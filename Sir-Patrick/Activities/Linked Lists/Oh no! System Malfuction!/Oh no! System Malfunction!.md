Oh no! System Malfunction!
by Patrick Roy Elalto

Enrollment season is coming up, but the system that stores all of the students data has suddenly encountered a malfunction, and has corrupted all of the data in the database! The system has suddenly lost all the data regarding the year level of all the students in the database, but luckily the rest of the information remains intact, especially the number of units the student has taken throughout their time in school.

Given that a students year level is all based on the units he/she/they/ze/xe/ver/te/e has taken, update all of the year levels of all the students in the list based on the following criteria on units.

0-47 units taken = 1st Year

48-95 units taken = 2nd Year

96-143 units taken = 3rd Year

144-191 units taken = 4th Year

192-240 units taken = 5th Year
