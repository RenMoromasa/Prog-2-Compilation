BIG? You must be smaller than me.

Create a function isDescending() that would check if the number in the list is in the descending order. The function would accept the collection of numbers stored in a linked list data structure (use the structure definition defined in the myheader.h). The function would return true if the numbers are in the descending order otherwise it will return false (use the bool data type defined in stdbool.h).

No need to implement the functions in the myheader.h; they have already been implemented and are hidden from you.

Add your answer below the labeled/commented section in the code specified by "Answer No.1 and Answer No.2".

Sample Output 1

Enter number of elements: 5
Enter element 1: 5
Enter element 2: 4
Enter element 3: 3
Enter element 4: 2
Enter element 5: 1
List: 5 4 3 2 1
The list is in descending order.
Sample Output 2

Enter number of elements: 5
Enter element 1: 5
Enter element 2: 3
Enter element 3: 2
Enter element 4: 1
Enter element 5: 4
List: 5 3 2 1 4
The list is not in descending order.
Sample Output 3

Enter number of elements: 5
Enter element 1: 1
Enter element 2: 2
Enter element 3: 3
Enter element 4: 4
Enter element 5: 5
List: 1 2 3 4 5
The list is not in descending order.
